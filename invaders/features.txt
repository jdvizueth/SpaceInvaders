Feature:
Multiple Waves

Process:
modified the __init__ method in Wave so that it would accept custom speeds for the aliens
and custom values for _lives. This allowed me to keep the old value for _lives and keep
the old value of the speed. Each time a wave ended, the speed of the aliens decreases by 0.1
until such speed is equal or less than 0. Once the speed of the aliens reaches 0 or lower,
then the game ends and the player wins.
